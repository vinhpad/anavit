A novel framework for document-level relation extraction that combines graph-based anaphora resolution with visual transformation techniques.

## Abstract

ANAVIT (Anaphor-Assisted Visual Transformation) enhances document-level relation extraction through two key innovations:
1. **Anaphor nodes integration** in document graphs to explicitly model pronoun-entity relationships via Graph Attention Networks
2. **Visual transformation** of relation matrices using convolutional neural networks and multi-head attention to capture global patterns

## Key Results

| Dataset | ANAVIT | ATLOP | Improvement |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| CDR     | 79.1%  | 69.4% | +9.7 points |
| GDA     | 84.7%  | 83.9% | +0.8 points |

## Features

- **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: Explicit modeling of anaphoric relationships through dedicated anaphor nodes
- **Graph Attention Networks**: Enhanced entity representation quality through coreference relationships
- **Visual Transformation**: Spatial processing of relation matrices for global pattern capture
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Learnable thresholds that adapt to each entity pair
- **SciBERT Integration**: Domain-specific pre-trained model for biomedical text

## Architecture

![ANAVIT Method Overview](anavit_method.png)

The ANAVIT pipeline consists of:

1. **Encoder Module**: SciBERT-based contextualized word representations
2. **GAT-based Entity Enhancement**: 
   - Anaphor detection using spaCy POS tagger
   - Heterogeneous document graph with mention and anaphor nodes
   - Graph Attention Networks for node interactions
3. **Visual Transformation Module**:
   - 2D convolution with 5Ã—5 kernels
   - Multi-head self-attention on spatial patterns
   - Three reasoning patterns for relation extraction
4. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic threshold learning per entity pair
